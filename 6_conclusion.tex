\section{Conclusion}

We have described a tool that allows people interested in dynamic gossip to explore the subject interactively.
The tool contains a visualisation of gossip graphs and allows users to execute calls and call sequences under several gossip protocols and observe the results. 
To evaluate the usefulness, a survey was sent out. 
Respondents evaluated the design and the presence of the error messages positively. 
All respondents considered the report useful in a study setting, and some also considered it useful in a research setting. 
Finally, we presented a number of ideas for improvements and extensions of the tool which could increase the usefulness of the tool.
