\begin{abstract}
The field of gossip---concerned with the way information spreads in networks of agents---has been the subject of research since at least 1927.
With the introduction of new paradigms within this field, such as dynamic and distributed gossip, the field has become more complex.
Information on dynamic (distributed) gossip is available in academic literature, but the protocols used and their consequences are not easily understood intuitively.
To improve ease of understanding, we present a tool for visualising gossip graphs and working with arbitrary gossip protocols.
The goal of the tool is to allow students and researchers to more quickly gain an understanding of the most important aspects of gossip.
To evaluate this goal, a survey was carried out among field experts.
Respondents reported they find the tool easy to use and consider it useful in a study setting.
Some users also considered the tool useful in a research setting.
Furthermore, feedback from the survey was used to improve the user experience and gain an understanding of which features are the most important to users.
